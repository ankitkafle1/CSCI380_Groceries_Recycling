# CSCI380_Groceries_Recycling
#Connection to Database link 
DATABASE_URL = mongodb+srv://csci380:csci380@cluster0.z047a.mongodb.net/CSCI380DB?retryWrites=true&w=majority

I made a .env file in backend directory, and put information of database connection on that file. One have to make that file, import dotenv moduel to make it work. Or one can put the url in App.js where in Place of DATABASE_URL
